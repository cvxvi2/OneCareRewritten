# OneCareRewritten
<h3>OneCare Rewritten</h3>
<p>This is an upload of the OneCare Rewritten project which can be found at https://onecare.cloudlillith.net. <br> This means that I've
yet to finalise the code, due to this, Windows XP isn't properly supported yet.</p>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>Head over to the <a href="https://github.com/cvxvi2/OneCareRewritten/releases">releases tab</a> and grab the latest release.</p>
<p>Insert your OneCare disc, and cancel any popups that show.</p>
<p>Launch OneCare Rewritten and follow the onscreen instructions to install.</p>
<h3>What does this do?</h3>
<p>This tool allows users of existing Windows Live OneCare medium to install it as normal.</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>The official setup file that comes on the OneCare discs attempts to reach Microsoft servers that no longer exist to download additional setup packages.</p>
<p>This bypasses this step by installing whats on your disc, the same way the original installer would've done if the servers were online.</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>OneCare setup ISO or disc mounted, all versions of the disc will work, this app will auto detect which version you have. Windows XP currently only supports 1.5.</p>
<h3>Supported OSes</h3>
<p>Windows Vista (Any edition) 32-Bit (Disc Versions 1.5, 2.0, 2.5)</p>
<p>Windows Vista (Any edition) 64-Bit (Disc Versions 2.0, 2.5)</p>
<p>Windows XP is currently in-development. The installer on here (as of 0.1.4) currently will only work for XP Service Pack 2 with a V1.5 'Gold' disc. All other versions currently won't work, likewise for Server 2008/r2. If anyone has an image of OneCare for Server, please let me know so I can look at adding support for this. XP support is functional under beta-testing using BOINC for 2.0 and 2.5, but not implemented into the installer</p>
<h3>Project Properties</h3>
<p>Platform: x86/32-Bit</p>
<p>Targetting Framework: .net 4.0</p>
<p>Visual Studio 2019 Community (2022 doesn't support legacy .net versions natively)</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Why isn't it themed like the original installer?</h3>
<p>I don't want an IP lawsuit. Microsoft own the original setup materials and explicitly state that the installer and it's contents are not to be redistributed
or modified in any form. This installer is built ground up and only designed to look similar to the original installer.</p>
<h3>Can I install OneCare without a disc or install media?</h3>
<p>No, for me to add support to that would be piracy. Buy a disc off eBay if you're interested.</p>
<h3>Is Windows 8/10/11 supported?</h3>
<p>No, and it never will be for that matter of fact. This software is old and the installer is built soley for use on XP to Vista-era machines for people
who want an authentic installation experience or to re-experience the blast from the past known as OneCare.</p>

<p>Big thank-you to MJD and Archive.Org for providing materials for me to create this.</p>
